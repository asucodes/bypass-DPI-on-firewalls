Step 1: Download v2rayN
Go to the official v2rayN GitHub page: https of://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases

Find the latest release (at the top).

In the "Assets" section, download the file named v2rayN-Core.zip. This is importantâ€”the Core version includes the Xray program that you need.

Unzip this file into a permanent folder (e.g., C:\v2rayN or on your Desktop).

Step 2: Run v2rayN
Inside the folder you just unzipped, find and double-click v2rayN.exe.

You will see its icon appear in your Windows System Tray (the little icons in the bottom-right corner of your screen).

Step 3: Add Your Server
Open the v2rayN main window by clicking its icon.

In the menu at the top, click Server -> Add [VLESS] Server.

A new window will open. You must fill in the details exactly as we configured them on the server:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Address (Host): your duck dns url goes here

Port: 443

ID (UUID): The YOUR_UUID you generated 
Flow: (leave this blank)

Encryption: none

Transport (Network): ws (or websocket)

Path: /my-secret-path (or whatever secret path you chose in Step 5)

Host: your ducks dns url (Yes, you enter this again here)

Transport Layer (Bottom Section): Select tls

SNI:  (This will likely auto-fill when you select tls)

Fingerprint: You can leave this blank or set it to chrome for better DPI resistance.
